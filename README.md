# How to Whale

This is the source for [howtowhale.com](https://howtowhale.com/).

Learn Docker in your web browser, no setup or installation required!

## How does it work?

With the help of [Carina](https://getcarina.com/), a Docker Swarm cluster is created just for you, running [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) in a Docker container. It's populated with a number of Jupyter notebooks where you can interact directly with your Docker Swarm cluster and learn Docker all from the comfort of your web browser. So is it magic? Nope, just massively abusing cool stuff for fun and profit.
